# HashMap implementation in React
In this project, I have implemented an HashMap class which has the following functionalities -
- `void put(key: number, value: number)` inserts a `(key, value)` pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding `value`.
- `number get(key: number)` returns the `value` to which the specified `key` is mapped, or `-1` if this map contains no mapping for the `key`.
- `void remove(key: number)` removes the `key` and its corresponding `value` if the map contains the mapping for the `key`.

## Installation

- Make sure you have Node installed (preferrably Node v18.17.1).
- Navigate to the project directory and run 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Once all the dependencies have been installed, run the following command to start the dev server.
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
